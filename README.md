SMART PET FEEDER SYSTEM

Overview:
The Smart Pet Feeder System is an IoT-based automation project designed to feed pets at scheduled intervals. It enables pet owners to manage feeding routines remotely, ensuring pets receive the right amount of food and water, even in the owner's absence. This system uses sensors, servo motors, a water pump, and Arduino-based control logic to dispense food and water based on programmed timing and real-time monitoring.

Features:

Automated Feeding Schedule: Dispenses food at regular intervals.

Water Monitoring: Refills the water bowl automatically when empty.

Servo-controlled Dispensing: Uses servo motors for controlled food release and disposal.

Ultrasonic Sensors: Detects food presence and water levels.

Arduino-based System: Core logic implemented on Arduino UNO.

User-Friendly Code: Modular and well-commented Arduino code for easy understanding and modification.
